            <img src="assets\images\chris.jpg" alt="Christopher L Glerup" class="img-thumbnail">
						<p>My whole life has been constant change, every three to four years I would move, which has its ups and downs, a down was finding out Virgnia really is for lovers, and an up was getting to live on a tiny island in Italy that 90% of people have never heard of .  Just in case your curious checkout <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=archipelago+de+la+maddalena&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjcjojGj-rgAhUDL6wKHedEBo4QsAR6BAgDEAE&cshid=1551758866127258&biw=1536&bih=706">Archipelego De La Maddelena </a>and you will be amazed by the beauty of a carved rock in the middle of the Medditeranian Ocean. After living in Italy I moved to Key West Fl followed by Seoul, Korea and than Portland, Tx. Which is where I call home due to the fact I recieved my Eagle Scout Award,  graduated high school, got my drivers license, and did the cliche thing and followed in my dads footsteps and Enlisted in the Navy for 10 short happy years.  Now I am living in Dallas and Ready to learn as much as I can at SMU Coding Boot Camp.</p>    </section>
